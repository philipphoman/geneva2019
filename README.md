# Reversal learning after exposure to combat trauma
## Invited talk, 4/2/19, University of Geneva
Although associative learning theory suggests that symptoms of
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) largely reflect maladaptive
learning during and after a traumatic event, classical threat
conditioning and extinction experiments in PTSD are often
inconclusive. Here, we used quantitative modeling to study reversal
learning in a Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm. We included
combat-exposed veterans who met PTSD criterion A with a wide range of
psychiatric symptoms and focused on trauma-related psychopathology and
its relationship to the latent variables of threat learning, using
Hierarchical Bayesian modeling and the best-fit heterogeneous DSM-IV
five-factor model of PTSD. We found greater sensitivity to prediction
errors in symptomatic veterans and decreased neural correlates of value
in the amygdala, in addition to smaller amygdala volumes. These results
support a crucial role of the amygdala structure and function in
symptoms of PTSD.
